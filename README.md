# RVstab
Calculate stellar radial velocity values using N-body integration of the entire system, and test proposed RV systems for long term stability. Code was first used in the analysis of the [planetary system around HD 200964](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04789). All numerical integrations are carried out using the [*rebound* package](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound).

## Getting started
A simple example of how the code is used can be found in [this jupyter notebook)](RVstab_example.ipynb). Full documentation [can be found here](https://people.ucsc.edu/~mmrosent/doc/built/html/doc.html), or in the doc folder.
